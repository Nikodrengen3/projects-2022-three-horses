# Inaugural project
In this project, we will solve various insurance problems. By generating data with grids using linspace and by using several loops containing utility functions and generated parameters, we solve the specific problems.
The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
